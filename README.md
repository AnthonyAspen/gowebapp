# gowebapp
This is my university project, created from the golang "Writing web applications" tutorial https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/
I haven't used "Make handler" function, and also regexp, to make the program easier to understand



The main goal is to comprehend the code.
additional changes that I have made:
1. New directories for templates and new pages.
2. Adaptive navbar (The main task is to make it without using JS)

Future TODO list is:
1. to make it possible to upload your own picture to a page what you are creating now
2. Connect mysql or postgresql to save your pages (and perhaps images)
